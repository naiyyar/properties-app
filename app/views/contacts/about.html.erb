				<h3>Mission</h3>

				<p><b>For Apartment Seekers:</b> To bring you shared experiences and opinions on NYC neighborhoods, management company landlords, apartments and buildings.</p>

				<p><b>For New Yorkers:</b> To give users a platform to share their NYC apartment experiences with the community. </p>

				<h3>About Us</h3>

				<p>Transparentcity launched with the goal to help people discover the hard to find information on NYC apartments.</p>

				<p>We are enabling the community to provide a clearer/accurate picture on many of the 250,000+ multi residential buildings and 300 neighborhoods in NYC.  There are millions of people living in this wonderful city each with varying experiences; good, bad and neutral.  However, there is no New York centric standard platform for them to share those experiences.  There are thousands of people considering moving into or around NYC everyday who want to know more about those detailed experiences.</p>
