				%h2 With Transparentcity
				%br
				%p Transparentcity connects Tenant Agents to prospective renters who are looking for personal guidance on navigating the complex rental process.  We place a simple solution in front of renters who seek help: You, the Tenant Agent, and the service you are licensed to provide.  Renters who contact Agents through the platform reach out by choice specifically looking for an Agent, and not under the guise of a listing. Renters with intent give you, the agent, a better opportunity to start your relationships strong and without the awkward surprises.
